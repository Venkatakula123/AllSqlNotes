1. Simplify Joins

• Decompose complex joins into simpler, more manageable queries when possible.
• Index columns that are used as foreign keys in joins to enhance join performance.

2. Query Structure Optimization

• Apply WHERE clauses as early as possible to filter out rows before they are processed further.
• Utilize LIMIT or TOP clauses to restrict the number of rows returned, which can significantly reduce processing time.

3. Partition Large Tables

• Divide large tables into smaller, more manageable partitions.
• Ensure that each partition is properly indexed to maintain query performance.

4. Optimize SELECT Statements

• Limit the columns in your SELECT clause to only those you need. Avoid using SELECT * to prevent unnecessary data retrieval.
• Prefer using EXISTS over IN for subqueries to improve query performance.

5. Use Temporary Tables Wisely

• Temporary Tables: Use temporary tables to save intermediate results when you have a complex query. This helps break down a complicated query into simpler steps, making it easier to manage and faster to run. 

6. Optimize Table Design

• Normalize your database schema to eliminate redundant data and improve consistency.
• Consider denormalization for read-heavy systems to reduce the number of joins needed.

7. Avoid Correlated Subqueries

• Replace correlated subqueries with joins or use derived tables to improve performance.
• Correlated subqueries can be very inefficient as they are executed multiple times.

8. Use Stored Procedures:

• Put complicated database tasks into stored procedures. These are pre-written sets of instructions saved in the database. They make your queries run faster because the database doesn’t have to figure out how to execute them each time.

As a Data Analyst, As you should be proficient in advance concepts of SQL . Here are a few advanced SQL methods:

1. Common Table Expressions (CTEs) - CTEs allow you to create temporary result sets that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. They are especially useful for breaking down complex queries into simpler, more readable components.

2. Window Functions - These functions perform calculations across a set of table rows that are related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions, window functions do not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row, allowing you to retain individual row information while performing calculations.

3. Subqueries and Correlated Subqueries - Subqueries can be used to provide data that will be used in the main query as a condition to further restrict the data to be retrieved. Correlated subqueries, which reference columns from the outer query, can dynamically adapt their results based on the current row being processed.

4. Pivot and Unpivot Operations - These operations enable you to transform rows into columns and vice versa, which is particularly useful for generating reports or reformatting data for analysis.

5. Recursive Queries - Using recursive CTEs, you can perform hierarchical or recursive data analysis, such as traversing a tree structure or generating a series of numbers.

6. Analytic Functions - These include ranking functions (e.g., RANK, DENSE_RANK), NTILE, and LEAD/LAG, which provide sophisticated ways to analyze data within partitions of the data set.


7. Advanced Joins - Mastering various types of joins (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, CROSS JOIN) and understanding their implications on query performance and result set structure is crucial for combining data from multiple tables effectively.

8. Indexing Strategies - Understanding how to create and use indexes efficiently can drastically improve the performance of your SQL queries, especially in large databases.

9. Query Optimization - Techniques such as analyzing query execution plans, avoiding unnecessary columns in SELECT statements, and leveraging database-specific optimization features can help in writing more efficient and faster SQL queries.

10. Dynamic SQL - This involves building SQL queries dynamically at runtime, which can be useful for applications that need to adapt queries based on user input or other dynamic factors.

Dimensional tables:

1. **Dimension Table Overview:**
 - In dimensional data modeling, a dimension table serves as a structured repository for descriptive information.
 - It complements the fact table by providing context and categorization for the numerical data stored within it.
 - Each dimension table corresponds to a specific aspect of the data, such as time, product, customer, or location.
 - For instance, a Time dimension table may include attributes like year, quarter, month, and day, offering a comprehensive framework for time-related data.

2. **Attributes and Characteristics:**

 - Within a dimension, attributes, or characteristics, allow for filtering, searching, and analysis of facts.
 - For example, within a location dimension, attributes could encompass state, country, and zipcode, facilitating detailed geographic analysis.

3. **Relationship with Fact Table:**

 - The dimension table is intricately linked to the fact table through foreign key relationships, enriching quantitative data with contextual information.
 - By joining the dimension table with the fact table, analysts can create a holistic view of the data, enabling deeper insights and analysis.

4. **Types of Dimensions:**
 - Various types of dimensions exist, each serving unique purposes within the data model.
 
 1. Conformed dimensions
2. Outrigger dimensions
3. Shrunken dimensions
4. Role-playing dimensions
5. Junk dimensions
6. Degenerate dimensions
7. Swappable dimensions




Here are ten common SQL interview questions related to NULL values, along with their answers, you can also check the video about the same in first comment.

1. What is NULL in SQL?
 Answer: NULL represents the absence of a value in a field. It is not the same as an empty string or zero; it is an unknown or undefined value.

2. How to check for NULL values in a column?
 Answer: Use the `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` condition in the WHERE clause.

 SELECT * FROM tableName WHERE columnName IS NULL;

3. What is the difference between NULL and an empty string?
 Answer: NULL represents the absence of a value, while an empty string is a valid string with zero length.

4. How to replace NULL values with a specific value in a query result?
 Answer: Use the `COALESCE` function.

 SELECT COALESCE(columnName, 'ReplacementValue') AS columnName FROM tableName;

5. Explain the behavior of the NULL value in aggregate functions.
 Answer: If an aggregate function encounters a NULL value, it generally ignores it, except for the `COUNT(*)` function, which counts all rows, including those with NULL values.

6. Can a table have multiple NULL values in a unique key column?
 Answer: In SQL Server, you can have only one NULL value in a unique key column.

7. How to insert a NULL value into a column during data insertion?
 Answer: Simply omit the column from the INSERT statement or explicitly use the keyword NULL.

 INSERT INTO tableName (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, NULL);

8. Explain the use of the `ISNULL` function.
 - Answer: The `ISNULL` function returns the specified replacement value if the expression is NULL; otherwise, it returns the expression itself.

 SELECT ISNULL(columnName, 'ReplacementValue') AS columnName FROM tableName;

9. How to count the number of NULL values in a column?
 Answer: Use the `COUNT` function with a CASE statement.

 SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN columnName IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS NullCount FROM tableName;

10. Can NULL values be indexed in SQL Server?
 Answer: Yes, NULL values can be indexed. However, keep in mind that querying for NULL values might be less efficient than querying for non-NULL values due to the way indexes work.
 
 
1. Why Rank skips the sequence?
 RANK(): Assigns the same rank to tied values but skips subsequent ranks, leading to gaps in the sequence.
 DENSE_RANK(): Assigns the same rank to tied values without skipping any ranks, providing a continuous sequence.
 The RANK() function in SQL assigns the same rank to rows with identical values but skips subsequent ranks, leading to gaps in the ranking sequence. This behavior occurs due to its handling of ties.
 
2. Why Order by fails in Minus Query?
3. Why Right Join when Leh Join can suffice the requirement?
4. Can we use aggregate functions without Group by clause?
5. Can we use Group by clause without aggregate functions?
6. In which scenario IN operator fails?

8. How to create an infinite loop using recursive cte?
9. Why WHERE fails to filter aggregate functions?
10. Name an example of Cross Join.
11. In which scenario NOT IN operator fails.
12. Name a scenario where sequence of columns matter in GROUP BY clause.
13. Name a reserved keyword which has two different functionality in SQL.
14. If two NULLS are not same then why distinct column shows only 1 null in the output?
15. How to find existence of NULL in a column without using IS NULL keyword.
16. Name two different keywords which performs the same task.
17. What's the difference between GROUP BY and PARTITION BY?
10.Miscellaneous
Conceptual Questions
18.What is the difference between DELETE,DROP and TRUNCATE?
19.Why CTEs are better than SUB QUERIES as far as performance is concerned?

31. What is the difference between INDEPENDENT AND CORRELATED QUERY?
32. Why window functions can't be used in WHERE CLAUSE?
33. Why column alias can't be used in WHERE CLAUSE but can be used in ORDER BY
CLAUSE?
34. What are the SQL keywords which have inbuilt distinct functionality apart from
DISTINCT?
35. Why WHERE CLAUSE nullify the impact of LEFT/RIGHT outer join in the output?
36. In which case NTILE can behave as ROW_NUMBER.


Decode: Decode will act as value by value substitution. For every value of field, it will
checks for a match in a series of if/then tests.
Syntax: DECODE (value, if1, then1, if2, then2, ……. else);
SQL> SELECT Supplier_Id, DECODE(Supplier_Id, 10000, 'IBM',10001, 'Microsoft',10002, 'Hewlett Packard','Gateway') Supplier_Name FROM Suppliers;
SQL> SELECT DECODE(1,1,3), DECODE(1,2,3,4,4,6) FROM DUAL;
 If the number of parameters are odd and different then decode will display nothing.
 If the number of parameters are even and different then decode will display last Value.
 If all the parameters are null then decode will display nothing.
 If all the parameters are zeros then decode will display zero.
The DECODE function is similar to the CASE statement in SQL, but with some differences:
DECODE compares a single expression, while CASE can compare multiple expressions.
DECODE uses the = operator for comparisons, while CASE can use other operators like <, >, <=, >=, and <>.
DECODE is specific to Oracle SQL, while CASE is a standard SQL construct available in most database systems.
Example: --select ename, empno, MGR,DECODE(mgr,7839, 'CEO', 7566, 'Manager') from emp;

NVL2(): Oracle 9i introduced NVL2() function. This function accepts three parameters.
Syntax: NVL2(exp1,exp2,exp3).
Here if exp1 is null, then it returns exp3. Otherwise it returns exp2.
Eg: SQL> select nvl2(null,10,20) from dual;
20


Having Clause
 This will work as where clause which can be used only with group by because of
absence of where clause in group by.
 On top of the Group by if we want to filter the groups then we use having clause.
